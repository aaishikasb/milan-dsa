<br>●	Randomized maps MUST be used. Verbal agreements will not receive staff support.
<br>●	A "Lag Test" is not required unless the non-hosting team requests one be completed. This is a test round that doesn't count and uses the standard game settings that will be used during the match. For the lag test, a map that is not scheduled for play must be used. If the game lags during this test, a new host must be chosen. If both teams cannot agree on an acceptable host, a ticket must be submitted by both teams to cancel the match.
<br>●	Teams may not delay the match for more than 5 minutes between each round/map. A round is defined as a stopping point during the match when match settings may be altered, and/or players may switch sides or change equipment.
<br>●	Hosting Rules: The higher ranked team on the ladder will host the first map. The lower ranked team will host the second map. Hosting will alternate between both teams until the final map in which the team with the most combined round wins from all prior maps will host the final map. In the event of both teams being unranked, the team with the Team ID closest to 1 will serve as the higher ranked team. In the event of combined tied rounds, the team who is closest to #1 on the ladder will host the final map. The team that is not hosting gets to choose which side to start on.
<br>●	Disconnection Clarification: The preparation phase is included in the first 30 seconds of the game.
<br>●	Exploit Clarification: Using Castle Armor Panel with Deployable Shield is a loss of that round for the Defenders.
<br>●	New Operators: The New Operators are allowed for use at this time.
<br>●	Defence Locations: In the event, a game has to be ended and restarted, a team may not choose the same Defend point on their next defence attempt if they successfully defended it. For an example, if a team successfully defends Master Bedroom on House and the game has to be restarted, that team may not choose that location on their next defence attempt. Violation will result in the loss of that round. &nbsp;<br></p>

</strong><br>The tournament will include only Squads. There will be 2 games each for every 100 people to obtain a final scorecard of every 100 people from which another 3 game round will be held. For Example: If there are 280 people registered for Solos, then there will be a total of 9 games which means 100 people will play 2 games then the remaining 100 of the 180 will play 2 games and then the remaining 80 will play 2 games and the final scorecard will be obtained of the 3 rounds of 2 games held. To give out a final scorecard Top 100 will be selected and will go in a 3 game tournament to obtain a final scorecard. Same will be followed in Squads format.<br><br><strong>2. Team and Player Names
</strong><br>Team or player names that are too similar to that of another team or player are subject to be changed by the admins.
<br>Only registered team members are allowed to play for a team or solo. Players and teams must compete under their officially registered PUBG team names and Nicknames during all official matches.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Game version
</strong><br>All players must install the newest version of the game in order to participate in the tournament. Updates must be installed before the tournament starts, so delays will be at a minimum.
<br><br><strong>4. Technical Issues
</strong><br>Teams are responsible for their own technical issues (hardware/internet). Matches will not be rescheduled because of technical issues and matches will be played nevertheless. In case of massive problems influencing a significant amount of players a replay of the map may be called.
<br><br><strong>5. Disqualification
</strong><br>To keep tournaments as efficient as possible, SRM Gaming Club reserves the right to disqualify teams. This will only be done in cases where a team purposefully stalls or attempts to block the tournament from starting.
<br>Usage of any 3rd party programs that enhance, add, modify, or remove game appearance, colour, or files, is strictly prohibited during this event. <strong>NO EMULATORS ARE ALLOWED.
</strong><br>Intentionally changing your character's angle to look through a texture or object is prohibited. The intentional use of any bugs, glitches, or errors in the game is strictly forbidden and will be penalized. Any team found to be using any known exploit will forfeit their game upon the first occurrence of the exploit. If the team is found to use another known exploit for a second time and it is determined to have been done on purpose they will be removed from the event and barred from any future events.
<br><br><strong>6. Player Eligibility
</strong><br>All players participating in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (henceforth PUBG) competitions must enter their PUBG game ID. The game account is needed to verify players in the room and to check if the correct player is playing. This account is the one visible inside the game when playing.
<br>Sign-ups will be closed one hour (1h) before the tournament starts. If you or your team has not signed up before this time you will be unable to participate.&nbsp;<br></p>
